Welcome to visit my blog. My name is **Bin Shi**, and I am studying Information Mangement at Northeastern University in Seattle from 2017 to 2019. Before, I was a software engineer in Oracle, and a tech lead in Sony for 9+ years in total. My prospective profession is to be a data engineer/scientist after graduation in May 2019. 

So I will show some of my school/side projects on this website, including technical articles related to #java, #python, #web-design, #database, #cloud-computing, #big-data and  #data-science.

In addition, I am very interested in PIM (Personal Information Management) and GTD (Get Things Done). So I will demonstrate my methodology and valuable tools to build a seamless data flow to collect data, extract knowledge, learn, and even memorize useful information. Sometimes, I will also write notes on my other hobbies like reading, travel, and photography.

Hopefully, you can learn something from my website. Have a nice day!
