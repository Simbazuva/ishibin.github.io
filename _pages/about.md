## Long Version
### Profession
I am studying Information Management at Northeastern University in Seattle from 2017 to 2019. Before, I was a software engineer in Oracle, and then a tech lead in Sony for 9+ years in total.

My prospective profession is to be a data engineer/scientist after graduation in May 2019. So I will show some of my school/side projects on this website, including some technical articles related to `java`, `python`, `web-design`, `database`, `cloud computing`, `big data` and `data science`.

### Interests
This blog is also about two of my most interesting topics.
***Mindfulness***. Maximum life experience with full attention.
***Productivity***. Maximum achievements during a limited life

I am still on the way to build my own methodology ,so I will write some articles to share with you my own observation and utilization from now and then. The ultimate purpose is to live a truly happy life with the greatest self.

Sometimes, I will also post some funny things like reading, travel, and photography.

Hopefully, you learned something from my website. Good dayðŸ˜Š
