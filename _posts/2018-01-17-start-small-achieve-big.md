Many people already know this, but why I mention it again, simply because it is very important and easy to forget.

Nowadays, people just want to accomplish big and fancy things and tend to ignore the small ones. However, the universal law cannot be ignored that **big achievements start from small**.  Finishing a marathon starts with a step of running and then the next step.

Writing a blog (and do not stop) is a big thing but it starts with a simple post. As to me, maybe it starts a feature of a programming language or a simple linear regression model. By keeping learning and practicing days after days, eventually, I will achieve big.
