&lt;p&gt;Nowadays, people just want to accomplish big and fancy things and tend to ignore the small ones. However, the universal law cannot be ignored that &lt;strong&gt;big achievements start from small&lt;/strong&gt;.  Finishing a marathon starts with a step of running and then the next step.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Writing a blog (and do not stop) is a big thing but it starts with a simple post. As to me, maybe it starts a feature of a programming language or a simple linear regression model. By keeping learning and practicing days after days, eventually, I will achieve big.&lt;/p&gt;

(I will write another post about the process.) So as the first post, it is essential for me to be very clear why I started this website. Only after that, I can continually write articles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why do I start this website?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;It’s a portfolio of my school/side projects or other competitions I participate in.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Writing can help me to keep track of my thoughts on two of my favorite subjects: mindfulness and productivity.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;It’s a simple approach to share my status and ideas without touching the overwhelming social media websites.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I hope my articles will also help others in some way.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
