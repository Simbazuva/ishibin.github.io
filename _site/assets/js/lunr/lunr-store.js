So as the first post, it is essential for me to be very clear why I started this website. Only after that, I can continually write articles.Why do I start this website?  Itâ€™s a portfolio of my school/side projects or other competitions I participate in.  Writing can help me to keep track of my thoughts on two of my favorite subjects: mindfulness and productivity.  Itâ€™s a simple approach to share my status and ideas without touching the overwhelming social media websites.  I hope my articles will also help others in some way.2018-01-06, Seattle","categories": [],
